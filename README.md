# P2-Platypodes Climate Tracker
* Welcome to our Trimester 3 Global Warming Statistics project. 
* With this ongoing problem of climate change and recent natural catastrophes resulting from it, we wanted users to be informed of the extent to which this global crisis is harming populations and the environment.
* We wanted to make a interactive tracker to make global warming data accessible to all in order to keep others educated about the crisis. 
* Other websites may be a bit difficult to navigate especially when cluttered with other news rather than purely climate change news. That's why we aim to create this clean website that will show you all the information that you will need to know!
* Learn more about our plan in the Project Plan below.

## Git Instructions
* You can learn about running this project on your IDE in this section:
* Go to Code home and click on the green "Code" button.
* Click on the clipboard next to the Git url. 
* Open up your IDE and "Run from Version Control".
* Press "Ctrl + V" or "âŒ˜ + V" and press the blue "Clone" button at the bottom.
* Once the project is opened up, be sure to change the interpreter to any version of Python 3. 
* Run the project from wsgi.py, and you're all set!

### Project Plan
* Here is where we started, we made a plan of action and hope to follow it closely and make this a website that can deliver all the needed info.

## Project Deliverable: Mini Lab
### Week of 3/29 - 4/2 
#### Ali's Lab: 
* [Individual section](https://github.com/Ali-Saad/p2-platypodes3/blob/master/members/ali/__init__.py) (blueprint) in project for Mini Lab definition and execution.
* Defining a class to manage a complex data set and creating an object from a class in Python. [(Link)](https://github.com/Ali-Saad/p2-platypodes3/blob/master/members/ali/Aliminilab.py)
* Data displayed on a web page.
* The insight I gained while doing this project has to do with the getters. Because I did not utilize variables within my code, utilizing getters was very harder to do since I had no sort of user input section; my user input must be changed from within the python file itself. I also gained insight about how list.append works since I needed to brush up on that concept.
#### Navodit's Lab
* Individual section (blueprint) in project for Mini Lab definition and execution.
* Defining a class to manage a complex data set and creating an object from a class in Python. (insert image)
* Data displayed on a web page.
* Wow
#### Pragadeesh's Lab
* [Individual Blueprint](https://github.com/Ali-Saad/p2-platypodes3/tree/master/members/pragadeesh)
* Class with objects and other parameters created to manage a complex data set of pascal's values. [(Code)](https://github.com/Ali-Saad/p2-platypodes3/blob/master/members/pragadeesh/pascal.py#L5-L27)
<img src = static/README/pr-class.png>  
* Data displayed in a web page by default with 11 rows (10th degree polynomial).
  * Input and button in the left corner to choose other order polynomials (other rows).
  * Data displayed in a triangle as the pascal's triangle should be
  * Code displayed at the bottom

* In this mini lab, there were many learning opportunities with lists and the prime usage of them as carriers of data. Lists were used to store data that would otherwise just be printed. It was interesting to see the various convoluted appends throughout the functions and classes to store the data and use POST to allow user interaction with the triangle.
#### Ayman's Lab
* [Individual section](https://github.com/Ali-Saad/p2-platypodes3/blob/master/members/ayman/__init__.py) (blueprint) in project for Mini Lab definition and execution. [Running page on website.](http://76.176.59.167/ayman/)
* Defining a class to manage a complex data set and creating an object from a class in Python. [(Link to code)](https://github.com/Ali-Saad/p2-platypodes3/blob/master/members/ayman/lab1.py)
* Data displayed on a web page. [(Link to code)](https://github.com/Ali-Saad/p2-platypodes3/blob/master/members/ayman/templates/lab1.html)
* During this mini lab, I grasped the usage and practical application of a Python class and object. My mini lab focuses on mathematical operations, more specifically, factoring any number between 1 and 100,000.
