# P2-Platypodes Climate Tracker
* Welcome to our Trimester 3 Global Warming Statistics project. 
* With this ongoing problem of climate change and recent natural catastrophes resulting from it, we wanted users to be informed of the extent to which this global crisis is harming populations and the environment.
* We wanted to make a interactive tracker to make global warming data accessible to all in order to keep others educated about the crisis. 
* Other websites may be a bit difficult to navigate especially when cluttered with other news rather than purely climate change news. That's why we aim to create this clean website that will show you all the information that you will need to know!
* Learn more about our plan in the Project Plan below.
