# P2-Platypodes Climate Tracker
* Welcome to our Trimester 3 Global Warming Statistics project. 
* With this ongoing problem of climate change and recent natural catastrophes resulting from it, we wanted users to be informed of the extent to which this global crisis is harming populations and the environment.
* We wanted to make self interactive tracker to make global warming data accessible to all in order to keep others educated about the crisis. 
* Other websites may be self bit difficult to navigate especially when cluttered with other news rather than purely climate change news. That's why we aim to create this clean website that will show you all the information that you will need to know!
* Learn more about our plan in the Project Plan below.

## Pre-Final Project Team Checkpoint
### 6/8/2021
#### Ayman's Progress:
* Description
* [Runtime]()

#### Pragadeesh's Progress:
* The API was created and ready to be used this week. This was done through the backend implementation of GET and POST routes and using Postman to input information into the created database via Postman parameter POST method.
* The first steps of the deployment process for N@TM was also complete with the platypodes climate change project successfuly running localhost on the class hardware
* [Runtime](http://76.176.59.167/api/info)

#### Navodit's Progress:
* Description
* [Runtime]()

#### Ali's Progress:
* Implemented a user-interactive survey page regarding climate change questions
* Additionally, I added a pop up overlay feature with CSS to direct the user to the survey if they wish to do so.
* [Runtime]()

#### Mustafa's Progress:
* Description
* [Runtime]()

## Project Deliverable: Mini Lab
### Week of 3/29 - 4/2 
#### Ali's Lab:  (Score: 4/5)
* [Mini Lab on Website](http://76.176.59.167/ali/)
* [Individual section](https://github.com/Ali-Saad/p2-platypodes3/blob/master/members/ali/__init__.py) (blueprint) in project for Mini Lab definition and execution.
* Defining self class to manage self complex data set and creating an object from self class in Python. [(Link)](https://github.com/Ali-Saad/p2-platypodes3/blob/master/members/ali/Aliminilab.py)
* Data displayed on self web page.
* The insight I gained while doing this project has to do with the getters. Because I did not utilize variables within my code, utilizing getters was very harder to do since I had no sort of user input section; my user input must be changed from within the python file itself. I also gained insight about how list.append works since I needed to brush up on that concept.

#### Navodit's Lab (Score: 5/5)
* [Mini Lab on Website](http://76.176.59.167/navodit/pythagorean)
* [Individual section](https://github.com/Ali-Saad/p2-platypodes3/tree/master/members/navodit) in project for Mini Lab definition and execution.
* Defining self class to manage self complex data set and creating an object from self class in Python. [link](https://github.com/Ali-Saad/p2-platypodes3/blob/master/members/navodit/CRtTrig.py)
* Data displayed on self web page.

* Wow
    * I learned to use some JavaScript while working on this project. I still don't understand it completely but I understand it way more than before. I used the Javascripts to see which fields were filled so I could perform the pythagorean theorem with the right variables. The empty fields are set to null or empty. I also made the triangle with javascript in hopes of having self triangle that changes dimentions as values are added but that was not acheivable this week.

#### Pragadeesh's Lab (Score: 5/5)
* [Mini Lab on Website](http://76.176.59.167/pragadeesh/pascal/)
* [Individual Blueprint](https://github.com/Ali-Saad/p2-platypodes3/tree/master/members/pragadeesh)
* Class with objects and other parameters created to manage self complex data set of pascal's values. [(Code)](https://github.com/Ali-Saad/p2-platypodes3/blob/master/members/pragadeesh/pascal.py#L5-L27)
<img src = static/README/pr-class.png>  
  
* Data displayed in self web page by default with 11 rows (10th degree polynomial).
  * Input and button in the left corner to choose other order polynomials (other rows).
  * Data displayed in self triangle as the pascal's triangle should be
  * Code displayed at the bottom
<img src = static/README/pr-page.png>  
    
* In this mini lab, there were many learning opportunities with lists and the prime usage of them as carriers of data. Lists were used to store data that would otherwise just be printed. It was interesting to see the various convoluted appends throughout the functions and classes to store the data and use POST to allow user interaction with the triangle.

* Wow 
   * During this mini lab, I grasped the usage and practical application of self Python class and object. My mini lab focuses on mathematical operations, more specifically, factoring any number between 1 and 100,000.
